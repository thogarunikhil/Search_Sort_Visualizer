## 1. Features

- Visualize various searching and sorting algorithms.
- Interactive and real-time graphical representation.
- Adjustable speed control to observe algorithms at different speeds.
- Takes customize input or randomly generates it.
- Detailed step-by-step explanations.
- Highlights key operations and comparisons.
- Shuffle option is available to shuffle the input elements.

## 2. Getting Started

To get started with the Search and Sort Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/thogarunikhil/Search_Sort_Visualizer.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Search_Sort_Visualizer`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install pygame random queue`
4. Run the python file: `python myProj.py`

## 3. Supported Algorithms

The visualizer supports the following searching and sorting algorithms:

- Searching Algorithms:
  - DFS (Depth First Search)
  - BFS (Breadth First Search)
  - A - star

- Sorting Algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort

## 4. Usage

Once you have launched the Search Sort Spectra in your web browser, follow these steps to use the application:

	1. Select if you want to search or sort.
	2. Search:
		a. Select the algorithm you want to visualize.
		b. After you select one of the algorithms, you would be presented with a grid of size 50x50 where you can select the starting and ending points of the search.
		c.  After this you can also add barriers in the grid, all these are to be done by selecting the appropriate cells by clicking the left mouse button. 
		d. You may remove these barriers by selecting it and clicking on the right mouse button. 
		e. Press SPACE bar to start the search.
		f.  After the search is complete you can clear the screen by pressing 'c' or return to the algorithms list by pressing 'x' in the keyboard
	3. Sort: 
		a. Select the way of input (custom or random)
		b. Custom :
			i. You can enter the input values separated by space in the input box.
		c. Random :
			i. 20 random values will be generated for you.
		d. Select the algorithm you want to visualize. There is also a shuffle button available to shuffle the data.
		e. After selecting the algorithm, you can visualize how that particular algorithm is sorting the number.
		f. Speed control option is also available to observe the process at different speeds.
		g. After the search is complete you can clear the screen by pressing 'c' or return to the algorithms list by pressing 'x' in the keyboard
	
		
## 5. Customization

The Search and Sort Visualizer can be customized to suit your preferences. Here are a few ways you can modify the application:

- Adjust the colors, fonts, and styles in the code to change the visual appearance.
- Modify the algorithms' implementation to add or remove features.
- Extend the application to support additional searching and sorting algorithms.
- Integrate with external libraries or frameworks to enhance functionality.
